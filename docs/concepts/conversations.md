description: How a message from a user becomes a conversation, what its status means, and what travels with it.
---

A conversation starts when a user sends a message from the SDK. It carries the message, the topic they picked, and what the SDK knows about their device. Everything that follows, replies, notes, status changes, is appended to it in order.

## Status

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Open | The user is waiting on you. New conversations start here, and a user reply on a pending conversation returns it here. |
| Pending | You are waiting on the user. Sending a reply moves the conversation here automatically. |
| Closed | Done. Closed conversations are never unread. |

You can set any status from the conversation header. Two things happen without you:

- A conversation that stays pending for 14 days is closed automatically.
- A user who answers "Was this helpful?" with yes after an assistant reply closes the conversation themselves.

If a user writes again within 7 days of a close, the conversation reopens. After 7 days their message starts a new conversation, linked to the old one.

## Topics

Users pick a topic when they start a conversation. Four are built in: **Bug**, **Feature request**, **Question**, and **Other**. The SDK shows them in the user's language. You can switch any of them off in **Settings → Topics** but cannot rename or delete them.

Add your own topics for anything specific to your product, such as "Billing" or "Sync". A custom topic has a name, translations, and a code the SDK sends. The code cannot be changed once created.

## What travels with a conversation

The SDK attaches what it can see, and the inbox shows it beside the thread:

- iOS: device model, OS version, app version and build, locale.
- Web: page URL, browser, OS, viewport, referrer, locale.

Anything you send with `identify` appears as well. See [Contacts](/docs/concepts/contacts/).

## Replies and notes

The reply box has two modes. **Reply** goes to the user and moves the conversation to pending. **Note** stays in the inbox for your team and changes nothing the user sees.

Type `/` in the reply box to insert a saved reply.

## Attachments

Users can attach up to 5 images per message, PNG, JPEG, or WebP, up to 10 MB each before the SDK resizes them. Other file types are not accepted. Attachments are available on paid plans.

## Unread

A conversation is unread when nobody on your team has seen its latest message. Opening it marks it read for everyone. Use **Mark unread** in the header to bring it back. Closed conversations never count as unread.
