description: One project per app or website, identified by a public project ID.
---

A project is one app or website and everything that comes from it: conversations, contacts, topics, answers, and settings. Create one project per product. An iOS app and its website can share a project if the same people answer both, or use two if you want separate inboxes.

## Project ID

Every project has an ID of the form `fd_` followed by 16 characters. Copy it from **Settings → Install**. The SDK sends it with every request so the server knows which project a message belongs to.

The ID ships inside your binary and in your page source, so anyone can read it. It is not a secret and never was: commit it, hard-code it, put it in a public repository. There is no way to rotate it and no need to.

Abuse of a public ID is handled by rate limits on the server, not by hiding the ID.

## What a project owns

- **Install**: the project ID and copy-paste snippets for iOS, web, and AI agents.
- **General**: name, slug, and the brand shown to users: brand name, accent colour, and the reply-time promise shown before and after a user sends a message.
- **Topics**: the choices users see when they start a conversation.
- **Data attributes**: the fields you send with `identify`.
- **Assistant** and **Knowledge**: automatic replies and the answers they draw on.
- **Saved replies**: snippets you insert into the reply box by typing `/`.
- **Email domain**: the domain replies are emailed from.
- **Members**: who can see this project's inbox.

## Development and production

Use one project for both. The SDK's `apiUrl` option exists so you can point a development build at a local server; the project ID stays the same. Create a second project only if you want test conversations out of your real inbox.
